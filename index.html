				Yoga, in the traditional sense, is a spiritual way of life that extends well beyond the complicated poses and breath work. The traditional practice of yoga is actually a rigorous spiritual discipline composed of a vast array of physical and mental exercises, in addition to philosophical, moral, and even nutritional practices, all aimed at self-transformation by union of the mind, body, and spirit. As such, yoga truly embodies a holistic approach to life and health. It takes even the most dedicated a lifetime to master. For the most part, however, since its introduction to the West in the late 1880s, yoga has undergone a metamorphosis into a more physically based “fitness yoga.” Many purists, however, still see this Westernized yoga form as an opportunity for exploring the deeper side of yoga and the spiritual aspects of life.<br>
				Yoga is complex even to define. The word yoga has several translations and comes from the root “yug” (to join), or “yoke” (to bind together). Essentially, yoga describes a method of discipline or means of uniting the body to the mind.he National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) classifies yoga as a mind-body therapy, defining it as “yoga—this combination of breathing exercises, physical postures, and meditation, practiced for over 5000 years, calms the nervous system and balances body, mind, and spirit.

					<p>Yoga is an Indian heritage involving physical, mental, and spiritual practice, which aims to transform body and mind. The ultimate goal of Yoga leads to Nirvana. Four major types of Yoga are mentioned in Indian classics based on the path individuals wish to choose [22]. The present practice of Yoga is a mix of Hatha Yoga and Raja Yoga, as they deal with meditation, posture, and breathing practices, which promote good health, including reproductive health. Raja Yoga deals with meditation, in which the mind is trained in eight steps as described by Patanjali. Hatha Yoga is about physical techniques supplementary to a broad construct of Yoga. It concentrates on body postures (asana), breathing techniques (Pranayama), and purification procedures (shuddhikriya). Bhakti Yoga is loving devotion to a deity. Jnana Yoga deals with the highest and continued quest for pure knowledge and understanding of nature.</p>

								Yoga is an ancient practice that has changed over time.<br>
								Modern yoga focuses on poses designed to stimulate inner peace and physical energy. Ancient yoga did not place as much emphasis on fitness. Instead, it revolved around cultivating mental focus and expanding spiritual energy.<br><br>
								There are many different types of yoga available. The style a person chooses will depend on their expectations and level of physical agility.
								People with certain health conditions, such as sciatica, should approach yoga slowly and with caution.<br>
								<br>Yoga can help support a balanced, active lifestyle.
